# NBA APP
I will be creating an NBA app. Users will have unique logins with authorization processes in place for security. Users will be able to search for players/teams and save favorite players to their account. Add comments to your favorite players (perhaps you'd like to predict a potential MVP or breakout player). Find details about players and teams to learn more about the game of basketball within the NBA API!

## USER STORY:
As a current (or potential) basketball fan, I want to be able to see details on players/teams to help understand the landscape of the game of basketball.

## MVP:
* Display information about players/teams that the user can search through.
* Allow users to 'favorite' players to save to their profile for quick access to their details page
* Allow users to add comments to their profile's favorite players

## STRETCH GOALS:
* Include images for teams (array of 30 images)
* Images for players (lots of players -- may have to find an api with existing images)
* Include player stats (unsure if this is something that needs to be decided on now or can be implemented later)
