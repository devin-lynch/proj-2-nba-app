I will be creating an NBA app. Users will have unique logins with authorization processes in place for security. Users will be able to search for players/teams and save favorite players to their account. Find details about players and teams to learn more about the game of basketball within the NBA API!





USER STORY
-------------
As a current (or potential) basketball fan, I want to be able to see details on players and teams to help understand the landscape of the game of basketball





MVP
-------
Display information about players/teams that the user can search through.
Allow users to 'favorite' players to save to their profile for quick access to their details page
Include images for teams (array of 30 images)


STRETCH GOALS
----------------
Images for players (lots of players -- may have to find an api with existing images)
Include player stats (unsure if this is something that needs to be decided on now or can be implemented later)
